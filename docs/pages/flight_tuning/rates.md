# Rates

> Draft scaffold. Extracted labels may be incomplete or out of order. Behaviour,
> displayed units, defaults and save effects require source review.

TODO: Explain what this page controls and when a pilot would use it.

## Where to find it

*Configuration* → *Flight Tuning* → *Rates*

Requires a running background task and a flight controller connection.

## Settings

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| TODO | Inspect the page and its helpers; automatic extraction found no controls. |

## Notes

- The largest value of each field is set by the firmware, not by the page: RC Rate
  up to 200, Shape and RC Expo up to 100 (`src/main/fc/rc_rates.h:25-27`). A value saved
  above the limit is cut to the limit at the next boot.

TODO: Verify persistence, reboot behaviour, profile scope and any restrictions in
this page and its shared helpers. Codec defaults may be UI fallbacks rather than
firmware defaults; wire values may need scaling before display.

## Source

[Page implementation](../../../src/wfsuite/app/pages/rates.lua). Menu conditions come from `app/tool.lua`.

*Scaffolded against WFSuite Ethos 2.3.1; content awaiting review.*
